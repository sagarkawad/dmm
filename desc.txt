a. mui, it basically is used to add beautiful ui components to your web application.
it is generally used with react js to prevent coding from scratch and get the components
directly into your web application. 

b. So we have used the DateCalendar component from mui in our
app and added the onClick listener to enable the punching functionality.


4. menu display - sakshi
